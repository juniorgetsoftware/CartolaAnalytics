			<p><strong>Yes, we can!</strong> That was a famous slogan used by Barack Obama during his running to the white house in 2008. Why am I saying it here? Because it is the perfect expression to summarize my experience of using Back4App. I have never heard about it before and I could implement an improvement to my application in just a few days.</p>

			<p>I am a huge fan of the <strong>CartolaFC</strong>, a fantasy game that explores real situations from teams and players of the Brazilian soccer championship. During the last 2 years, I was getting information from a really good website to support me on the choice of  players for each round. It showed lots of information in an easy way to understand. Unfortunately, this website is no longer available. Consequently, I started thinking about developing my own application.</p>
			<p>In such a way to satisfy my needs, I developed a Windows&#174 application called <strong>Cartola Analytics</strong> using the following technologies: C#.NET with WPF and MSSQLServer Database.</p>
